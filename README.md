Handwritten detector using deep learning technologies trained on custom dataset.

You can visit and download the kaggle dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanmayp2311/handwritten-digits-and-basic-operators).

Used TensorFlow and Keras for model development and matplotlib for visualisation. Also used OpenCV (cv2) to pre-process the images.
