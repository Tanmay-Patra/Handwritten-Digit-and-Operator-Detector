# Handwritten Math Equation Solver

Handwritten detector using deep learning technologies trained on MNIST and custom operator dataset.

Used TensorFlow and Keras for model development and matplotlib for visualisation. Also used OpenCV (cv2) to pre-process the images.
Used CNN for digit classifier and Random Forest for operator classifier.
